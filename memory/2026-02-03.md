# 2026-02-03 — Overnight Sprint

## Plan (23:36 CST)
Alberto sleeping 7 hours. Sprint to level up SandGuard.

### Sub-agents launched:
1. **auth-jwt** — JWT auth persistence (backend + frontend)
2. **tx-history** — Historical transaction log feature
3. **policy-engine** — Basic dangerous pattern detection
4. **security-fix** — Payload size limits + security hardening
5. **landing-upgrade** — Landing page copy/design upgrade
6. **api-docs** — API documentation page
7. **blog-content** — 2-3 new SEO blog posts
8. **deploy-test** — Final git push + Railway deploy + E2E

## Progress

### 23:37 — Sub-agents launched
- auth-jwt: running
- policy-engine: running  
- landing-upgrade: running
- docs-and-blog: running
- security-and-history: FAILED (connection error + gateway timeout due to RAM pressure)
  → Will retry after other agents complete

### 23:47 — auth-jwt ✅ COMPLETE
- Created: backend/src/middleware/auth.ts, backend/src/middleware/validation.ts
- Created: backend/src/routes/auth.ts  
- Updated: frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx
- JWT auth with 30-day tokens, signup/login/me/refresh endpoints

### 23:48 — docs-and-blog ✅ COMPLETE
- Created: frontend/src/pages/ApiDocs.tsx (15KB, full API documentation)
- Created: docs/how-to-protect-your-dao-treasury.html (25KB blog post)
- Created: docs/transaction-simulation-explained.html (29KB blog post)
- Updated: docs/index.html (added new posts to listing)

### RAM Status
- 732MB/906MB used, 1055MB swap used
- Gateway process using 219MB
- Need to wait for sub-agents to finish before spawning more

### 03:00 — 3AM Heartbeat Check
- ✅ supersandguard.com is UP (200 OK)
- ✅ All overnight sub-agent changes committed: `6e0204f` (26 files, 3465 insertions)
  - JWT auth (middleware + routes)
  - Policy engine (backend service + routes + frontend badges)
  - API docs page (ApiDocs.tsx)
  - 2 blog posts (DAO treasury, tx simulation)
  - Landing page upgrade
  - TxDetail improvements
  - Research docs (agentmail, blockworks, construction agent)
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub → Railway auto-deploy triggered
- ⚠️ WhatsApp gateway disconnected (status 408 at 23:44) — may need reconnect before 7AM summary
- Sub-agents not running — all completed or timed out. security-and-history never ran (RAM pressure)
- Next cron fire: 5AM, 7AM (7AM = send Alberto the summary)
