# Mission Control Twitter Thread - Final

**Tweet 1:**
Everyone talks about "AI on a Raspberry Pi for $35" like it matters. It doesn't. The Pi is just hardware. The interesting part is what we built to control what's inside.

**Tweet 2:** 
Mission Control isn't a dashboard for machines. It's a dashboard for minds. You edit personality files and watch an AI agent's behavior change in real-time.

**Tweet 3:**
Think live editing, but for temperament. Edit the cynicism values in SOUL.md, suddenly the agent gets more skeptical. Adjust verbosity settings, it starts speaking differently. No restarts needed.

**Tweet 4:**
You spawn sub-agents and design their personality from scratch. Knowledge base, skills, communication style. Like hiring, except you literally write how their mind works.

**Tweet 5:**
Matrix had it backwards. Neo downloaded skills for himself. Here you're designing how other minds think and orchestrating the whole operation. You're the architect.

**Tweet 6:**
Need someone analytical? Edit their skepticism parameters. Want creativity? Adjust risk tolerance. No HR meetings about "cultural fit." You design the culture by designing how each mind processes information.

**Tweet 7:**
Create agents, delete them, modify them in real-time. The weirdest part isn't the tech. It's watching someone's personality change as you edit their files.

**Tweet 8:**
Most people want AI to think for them. We built something where you control how AI thinks. Different problem. Different solution.

**Tweet 9:**
We just open-sourced the whole thing. Because building tools in private is pointless.

Node.js + React dashboard that runs on a $35 Pi. Monitor sessions, edit agent personalities, see real-time thinking. By @beto_neh and an AI agent.

## Screenshot Suggestions:
1. **Most impactful:** Dashboard overview showing live session monitoring with the file editor open on SOUL.md - shows both the "mind control" aspect and the real-time monitoring
2. **Alternative:** Close-up of SOUL.md editor with personality parameters visible (cynicism, verbosity, etc.) - demonstrates the "personality editing" concept clearly
3. **Technical proof:** Terminal/system view showing it running on a Raspberry Pi with resource usage

## Changes Made:
- Removed some of the more hyperbolic language ("neurosurgery for temperament" - too much)
- Made claims more specific and concrete
- Added open source announcement and GitHub link as separate tweets
- Focused on actual functionality rather than metaphors
- Kept the core insight about controlling how AI thinks vs. having AI think for you
