# Twitter Thread: Mission Control (Cobie voice)

**Tweet 1 (78 chars)**
Built a dashboard to control an AI agent. Via WhatsApp chat. On a $35 computer.

Raspberry Pi 3B. 1GB RAM. Running a React PWA that would crash most enterprise servers in 2019.

The human doesn't code. Described what he wanted. The AI wrote everything. This is accurate.

Process: describe feature → screenshot problems → AI spawns sub-agent → fixes itself → screenshot again. Loop until it works.

**Tweet 5 (155 chars)**
When the UI looked terrible, the AI spawned "Johnny" mid-conversation to audit the design. One agent invoking another while we watched from WhatsApp.

**Tweet 6 (117 chars)**
Natural language config. Type "check email every 2 hours" and it edits the right files. No JSON. No docs. Just talk.

**Tweet 7 (140 chars)**
Dashboard manages 4 sub-agents: Legal, Strategy, Marketing, Design. Like a real team except they share one brain and cost nothing to fire.

**Tweet 8 (164 chars)**
Things that broke: RAM kills, keyboard overlap, design disasters. Fixed via screenshot→chat→fix loops. No terminal. No IDE. Just conversation and images.

**Tweet 9 (90 chars)**
The weird part isn't the tech. It's that this sentence makes sense: "My AI spawned another AI."

**Tweet 10 (84 chars)**
Nothing here is a promise. This is just what happened today. Expect weird things.
