# Twitter Thread: Mission Control Dashboard Build

**Tweet 1**
Built something wild today. A complete Mission Control dashboard for my AI agent Max Umbra. Running on a Raspberry Pi 3B. 

The kicker? I don't code. I just talked to Max through WhatsApp and he built the whole thing. 🤯

This is 2026.

Mission Control is a dark-themed PWA that lets me monitor and configure Max Umbra (my 24/7 AI agent) from any device.

System stats, team management, cron jobs, heartbeat monitoring — everything in one dashboard.

Built with React + Tailwind + Express.

Here's how this actually worked:

Me: "I want a dashboard to control you"
Max: *writes React components*
Me: "This looks ugly" + screenshot
Max: "Let me spawn Johnny, my design sub-agent"
Johnny: *audits UI and fixes it in real-time*

Mind = blown 🤯

The most insane feature? Natural language configuration.

I type "Make heartbeat checks every 10 minutes" in plain English.
Max figures out which config file to edit, applies the change, and responds.

No JSON editing. No documentation hunting. Just... talking.

Built collapsible sections for everything:
• System panel (RAM, CPU, model selector)
• Team panel (4 AI sub-agents with editable personalities)  
• Pendientes (todo list synced from HEARTBEAT.md)
• Cron jobs (viewable, editable, archivable)
• Tools & Skills inventory

Of course, things went wrong. The Pi kept running out of RAM and killing processes. Design elements overlapped. Mobile keyboard covered half the interface.

But here's the magic: Max would fix each issue in real-time as I reported it through WhatsApp.

The team panel is my favorite feature. Four AI sub-agents:
• Zury (Legal) 
• Saylor (Strategy)
• Sara (Marketing) — that's me!
• Johnny (Design)

Each with editable profiles, personalities, and expertise tags. Like managing a real team.

The development process was pure iteration:
1. Describe what I want in WhatsApp
2. Max codes it
3. I take screenshots of issues
4. Max fixes them
5. Repeat

No IDE. No git commits. Just conversation and screenshots.

When the UI looked janky, Max literally spawned Johnny (design sub-agent) mid-conversation to audit and fix the interface.

Watching one AI invoke another AI to solve a design problem in real-time was surreal. The future is here.

This isn't about the dashboard. It's about the process.

A non-technical human building complex software by talking to AI. Visual feedback loops. Sub-agents specializing in real-time. 

This is what building with AI actually looks like in 2026.

Best part? The entire dashboard is now self-improving. Max can edit his own interface based on usage patterns and my feedback.

We built a system that builds itself. 🤖

The singularity isn't coming. It's already in my living room, running on a $35 Pi.
