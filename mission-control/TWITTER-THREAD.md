# Twitter Thread: Mission Control Dashboard Build

**Tweet 1**
Built a Mission Control dashboard today. A Raspberry Pi 3B running a PWA to monitor and configure an AI agent.

The weird part? It was built entirely through WhatsApp conversation.

Dark-themed PWA. System stats, team management, cron jobs, heartbeat monitoring — everything in one dashboard.

React + Tailwind + Express. Running on a $35 computer with 1GB of RAM.

How this actually worked:

Me: "I want a dashboard to control you"
Max: *writes React components*
Me: "This looks ugly" + screenshot
Max: "Let me spawn Johnny, my design sub-agent"
Johnny: *audits and rewrites the UI*

Most interesting feature: natural language configuration.

Type "check my email every 2 hours" and the agent figures out which config file to edit, applies the change, and confirms.

No JSON. No docs. Just talking.

Collapsible sections for:
• System (RAM, CPU, model selector)
• Team (4 sub-agents with editable personalities)
• Pendientes (synced todo list)
• Cron jobs (view, edit, archive)
• Tools & Skills inventory

All live, all from the phone.

Things went wrong. The Pi kept running out of RAM mid-build. Design elements overlapped. Mobile keyboard covered the input field.

Each issue got fixed through the same loop: screenshot → WhatsApp → fix → screenshot.

The team panel manages four sub-agents:
• Zury (Legal)
• Saylor (Strategy)
• Cobie (Marketing)
• Johnny (Design)

Editable profiles, personalities, expertise tags. Like a real team, except they share one brain.

The development loop:
1. Describe what we want
2. Code it
3. Screenshot issues
4. Fix them
5. Repeat

No IDE. No terminal. Just conversation and screenshots.

When the UI looked off, Max spawned Johnny mid-conversation to audit the interface. One agent invoking another to fix a design problem while I watched from WhatsApp.

That's a weird sentence to type.

This isn't about the dashboard.

A human who doesn't code and an AI on a Pi building software through conversation. Visual feedback. Sub-agents specializing on demand.

Nothing here is a promise. Expect weird things.
