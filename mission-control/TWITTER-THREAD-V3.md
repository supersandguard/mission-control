### 1/4

Most people want AI to think for them. We wanted to control how AI thinks.

Mission Control is a dashboard for editing agent minds. You open a file called SOUL.md, change the personality parameters, and the agent's behavior changes in real-time. No restarts. No redeployment. Just a text file and a save button.

Runs on a $35 Raspberry Pi because the hardware was never the interesting part.

### 2/4

You spawn sub-agents and write how their mind works. Skepticism, verbosity, risk tolerance, communication style — all in editable files.

It's like hiring, except there's no interview and no guessing. You design exactly how each one processes information. The weirdest part is watching personality shift as you edit.

### 3/4

Most "AI tools" are wrappers around an API call with a nice UI. This is the opposite — it's the control layer. Monitor sessions, see real-time thinking, orchestrate multiple agents from one place.

We built it because we needed it. Then open-sourced it because building tools in private is pointless.

*v3 — condensed from 10 to 4. No fluff removed because there was none to begin with.*
